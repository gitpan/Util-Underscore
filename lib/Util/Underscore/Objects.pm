=item C<$str = _::blessed $obj>

=item C<$str = _::blessed>

=item C<$str = _::class $obj>

=item C<$str = _::class>

Accesses the class of the provided object.

Wrapper for C<Scalar::Util::blessed>.

B<$obj>:
the object of which the class is to be determined.
If omitted, uses C<$_>.

B<returns>:
The class of C<$obj> if that is a blessed scalar, else returns C<undef>.

=item C<$bool = _::is_object $scalar>

=item C<$bool = _::is_object>

Checks that the argument is a blessed object.
It's just an abbreviation for C<defined _::blessed $scalar>.

B<$scalar>:
the scalar which may or may not be a blessed object.

B<returns>:
a boolean indicating whether the C<$scalar> is a blessed object.

=item C<$bool = _::class_isa $class, $supertype>

Checks that the C<$class> inherits from the given C<$supertype>, both given as strings.
In most cases, one should use C<_::class_does> instead.

B<$class>:
the name of the class.

B<$supertype>:
the name of another class.

B<returns>:
a boolean indicating whether C<$class> inherits from C<$supertype>.

=item C<$bool = _::class_does $class, $role>

Checks that the C<$class> performs the given C<$role>, both given as strings.
This means that the C<$class> has a compatible interface to the C<$role>.
However, this does not require that the C<$class> inherits from the C<$role>.

B<$class>:
the name of the class.

B<$role>:
the name of a role.

B<returns>:
a boolean indicating whether C<$class> conforms to the C<$role>.

=item C<$bool = _::isa $object, $class>

Checks that the C<$object> inherits from the given class.
In most cases, one should use C<_::does> or C<_::is_instance> instead.

B<$object>:
a scalar possibly containing an object.

B<$class>:
the name of a class:

B<returns>:
a boolean indicating whether the C<$object> inherits from the given C<$class>.
Returns false if the C<$object> parameter isn't actually an object.

=item C<$code = _::can $object, $method>

Checks that the object can perform the given method.

    if (my $code = _::can $object, $method) {
        $object->$method(@args);
    }

B<$object>:
a scalar.

B<$method>:
the name of the method to search.

B<returns>:
if the C<$object> can perform the C<$method>, this returns a reference to that method.
A false value is returned in all other cases (the object doesn't know about that method, or the C<$object> argument doesn't actually hold an object).

=item C<$bool = _::is_instance $object, $role>

=item C<$bool = _::does $object, $role>

Checks that the given C<$object> can perform the C<$role>.

B<$object>:
a scalar possibly containing an object.

B<$role>:
the name of a role.

B<returns>:
a boolean value indicating whether the given C<$object> conforms to the C<$role>.

=item C<< any = $maybe_object->_::safecall(method => @args) >>

This will call the C<method> only if the C<$maybe_object> is a blessed object.
We do not check that the object C<can> perform the method, so this might still raise an exception.

Context is propagated correctly to the method call.
If the C<$maybe_object> is not an object, this will simply return.
In scalar context, this evaluates to C<undef>, in list context this is the empty list.
